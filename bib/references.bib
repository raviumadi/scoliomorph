            This study was designed to characterize the vertebral body (VB) shape, focusing on vertebral wedging, along the thoracic and lumbar spine, and to look for shape variations with relation to gender, age, and ethnicity. All thoracic and lumbar (T1–L5) dissected vertebrae of 240 individuals were measured and analyzed by age, gender, and ethnicity. A 3D digitizer was used to measure all VB lengths, heights, and widths, and their ratios were calculated. This study showed that the VB size was independent of age or ethnicity. VB left lateral wedging was found in most vertebrae of most individuals, yet systematically was absent in six vertebrae (T4, T8–T9, T11, L3–L4) with a greater tendency in females than males (∼92\% vs. 86\%). The VB was anteriorly wedged from T1 through L2 (peak at T7), nonwedged at L3, and posteriorly wedged at L4–L5 (peak at L5). VB width decreased from T1 to T4 and then increased toward L4–L5, so that the spinal configuration in the coronal plane resembled two pyramids of opposite directions, sharing an apex at T4. The inferior VB width was significantly greater than the superior width of both the same vertebra and the adjacent lower vertebra, indicating a trapezoidal shape of the VB and an inverted trapezoidal shape of the intervertebral space. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the human vertebra, in its normal condition, maintains its external dimensions with age, independent of gender or ethnic origin. Clinical and surgical implications of the unique thoracolumbar architecture are discussed. Clin. Anat. 21:46–54, 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Quantitative evaluation of axial vertebral rotation is essential for the determination of reference values in normal and pathological conditions and for understanding the mechanisms of the progression of spinal deformities. However, routine quantitative evaluation of axial vertebral rotation is difﬁcult and error-prone due to the limitations of the observer, characteristics of the observed vertebral anatomy and speciﬁc imaging properties. The scope of this paper is to review the existing methods for quantitative evaluation of axial vertebral rotation from medical images along with all relevant publications, which may provide a valuable resource for studying the existing methods or developing new methods and evaluation strategies. The reviewed methods are divided into the methods for evaluation of axial vertebral rotation in 2D images and the methods for evaluation of axial vertebral rotation in 3D images. Key evaluation issues and future considerations, supported by the results of the overview, are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We trained a deep neural network for the three-dimensional estimation of the direction of the three anatomical axes (cranio-caudal, anteroposterior and laterolateral) of individual vertebrae from a single sagittal radiographic image acquired from an approximately lateral direction with large deviations from a perfect alignment up to 60 degrees. To this aim, we exploited computed tomography (CT), which can be used to create simulated radiographic projections with different orientations, for the creation of large training and validation datasets. In a set of 21 CT stacks, the location of 5 landmark points was manually determined for L2, L3 and L4, for a total of 63 vertebrae. For each vertebra, 200 simulated projections approximately aligned with sagittal plane but including random perturbations of the projection direction were built, resulting in 12,600 simulated radiographs with the corresponding local directions of the anatomical axes. These data were integrated by 1765 lateral images of vertebrae acquired with a biplanar radiographic imaging system, for which the orientation was calculated by means of three-dimensional reconstruction. The whole dataset was used to train a deep neural network, ResNet-101, customized for the estimation of the three-dimensional components of the axes. The accuracy of the network was qualitatively and quantitatively tested on a large group of simulated radiographic images as well as real lateral images acquired with a biplanar radiographic system for which the direction of the axes was known. Errors were lower than 3 degrees in 76\% of the evaluations conducted on the simulated images, and in 86\% for the real radiographs. The novel method will be useful to extract three-dimensional information from planar images even in clinical cases in which vertebrae are markedly rotated due to spinal deformities or to an imprecise alignment of the patient with respect to the detector.},

	abstract = {Automatically detecting vertebral bodies in X-Ray images is a very complex task, especially because of the noise and the low contrast resulting in that kind of medical imagery modality. Therefore, the contributions in the literature are mainly interested in only 2 medical imagery modalities: Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR). Few works are dedicated to the conventional X-Ray radiography and propose mostly semi-automatic methods. However, vertebra detection is a key step in many medical applications such as vertebra segmentation, vertebral morphometry, etc. In this work, we develop a fully automatic approach for the vertebra detection, based on a learning method. The idea is to detect a vertebra by its anterior corners without human intervention. To this end, the points of interest in the radiograph are ﬁrstly detected by an edge polygonal approximation. Then, a SIFT descriptor is used to train an SVM-model. Therefore, each point of interest can be classiﬁed in order to detect if it belongs to a vertebra or not. Our approach has been assessed by the detection of 250 cervical vertebræ on radiographs. The results show a very high precision with a corner detection rate of 90.4\% and a vertebra detection rate from 81.6\% to 86.5\%.},

We take the view that, in determining their rotation angles from X-rays, the procedure applied by Drerup yields the most reliable empirical results, viz. the three angles through which a vertebra rotates about its own symmetry axes in a specific sequence. With a view to the further use of this information to analyze deformations or the motion of a spine we recommend that the Drerup angles be converted into the well-known Eulerian angles. How this can be done is the subject of this report.},
